This folder contains the data for custom spawners. NBT files in this folder
can be referenced as spawner types in dungeon config files. See default.cfg
for more details.

Each custom spawner is an NBT file containing the tags required to create
the spawner object. You may add your own files by editing the defaults
using an NBT editor. It may also be possible to extract the tags from an
existing spawner in a Minecraft level and use that. (But this has not been
tested.) NBTExplorer is recommended for editing:

Spawners can be very simple, or potentially a very complex tree of values.
The most simple example would be a single string tag, called EntityId and
containing the EntityId of the mob you want to spawn. The Id, x, y and z
tags are unnecessary as they are added by MCDungeon.

For more information on the format of the tags see:
	* http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Chunk_format#Tile_Entity_Format
	* http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Chunk_format#Mobs
	
IMPORTANT: If you provide Minecraft with incorrect tags, it can potentially
crash it. Please use this feature with caution.
